# Infusions

## Infusions

Introduced in firmware 1.1.0 for the WiFi Pineapple Mark IV, Infusions allow the community to make extensions for the System's WebUI. Infusions can range from front-ends for command-line utilities to full-featured extended functionality such as text messaging your Pineapple, changing its wireless settings or injecting content into unsuspecting internet browsers. Infusions can be programmed in PHP, JavaScript/AJAX, Python, Perl, or BASH.

## Command Line Infusions

Command line Infusions were introduced in firmware 1.1.0 for Mark V Pineapple. Command line Infusions are just like regular Infusions except they don't have a front-end for the WebUI. Command line Infusions can be programmed in PHP, Python, Perl, or BASH.

## Creating Infusions

[Creating Infusions](creating_infusions.md) on the Mark V firmware is very simple. Go to the "Pineapple Bar" in your Pineapple's WebUI. This allows you to create a new infusion, or manage your existing infusions. The new Pineapple Bar also has a built-in basic text editor for quickly whipping up an Infusion.

## Supporting your Infusion

It is recommended that if you decide to submit your infusion for approval, you make a thread in the correct WiFi Pineapple subforum at the [Hak5 Forums](https://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/forum/64-wifi-pineapple-jasager/). Your thread should include information about the infusion, its features and a changelog.

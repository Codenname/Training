# Blackout

Blackout is an infusion available on the [Pineapple Bar](../pineapple_bar.md) that provides the ability to toggle the state of the Pineapple LEDs from the [WebUI](../webui.md).

## Functionality

This infusion has a simple graphical interface that allows the user to selectively turn on or off all of the LEDs on the Pineapple, except for the power indicator which cannot be disabled.

### Small Tile

The small tile gives the user quick access to two small buttons, one to turn off all LEDs and one to turn them all on.

### Large Tile

Blackout's large tile interface is not much more complex, but it provides control over each LED individually. If for example the user was tired of seeing the flashing LED associated with wlan1, all he or she would need to do is click the button labeled 'Red Off' and it would be disabled. Once he/she started to miss it, clicking 'Red On' from within the large tile would start it again, blinking as fast and as bright as ever.

# Commander

Commander is an Infusion that enables you to communicate with your WiFi Pineapple over the IRC Protocol. You may choose a server, port, nickname, channel and prefix to communicate to your pineapple with. It uses PHP and AJAX for the front end and uses Python for the backend, thus needing Python installed.
